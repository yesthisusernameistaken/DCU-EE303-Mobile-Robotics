This was a project for EE303 Mobile Robotics. 
We were tasked to build a mobile robot using Lego and program a Handyboard capable of following a line, picking up and dropping off passengers at various locations.

The destinations were predefined locations on the tack (marked by lines on the floor), each passenger was represented as a block with black and white stripes used to differentiate them. The robot would need to be capable of reading the strips and navigating to the designated location. The circuit consisted of a white line with various junctions and dead ends.
